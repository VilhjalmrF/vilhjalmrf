Hello there. My name is William. I guess I do code? Aspiring to be a game developer.

# What are you currently working on?
For now a simple webpage to show off my awful skills. As you can see it [here](https://vilhjalmrf.github.io/). Hopefully soon I can have a devlog page going to show off the progress of whatever game I'll create soon.
